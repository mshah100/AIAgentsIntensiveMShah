### Problem Statement
I have a sweet tooth, but I want to create innovative treats with minimal health impact using dates and raisins. This gives me plenty of guilt-free options, and with a list of nearby stores carrying the ingredients, it even helps streamline my shopping.

### Why agents?
I created agents that work sequentially to give me the recipe, ingredients, and a list of stores—all in one go. It’s far more efficient than searching for each recipe and searching the store for ingredients separately.

### What you created
I am very found of cooking so I wanted to explore agents for getting me the recipe for the sweet dish.


### Demo -- I created the recipe agent to do a google search as the tool.  The ingredients agent is being created to extract the ingredients from the response of the recipe agent and then the shopping agent is to locate the stores that carry all the ingredients & finally the pricing agent to get us the price range for all the items for the recipe.  These agents are called using a Sequential agent.  

### The Build -- I have used agents and gemini-flash-lite-2.5 model and used the sequential agent to call the agents to get the response

### If I had more time, this is what I'd do
I would like to install and enable an MCP server for accessing a database to get the enhanced recipes and possible user VertexAIMemory as opposed to the im memory runner.
