Press the dough evenly into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan. If using a store-bought crust, prepare it according to package instructions.\n2.  **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).\n3.  **Make the Filling:**\n    *   In a food processor, combine the pitted and chopped Medjool dates and maple syrup. Pulse until combined.\n    *   Add 1/2 cup of the pumpkin puree to the date mixture and process until smooth.\n    *   Add the remaining pumpkin puree, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt. Process until well combined.\n    *   Add the eggs one at a time, processing until each is well incorporated. If using vanilla extract, add it now.\n    *   Gradually mix in the milk until the filling is thoroughly blended.\n4.  **Assemble the Pie:** Pour the pumpkin pie filling into the prepared pie crust.\n5.  **Bake:** Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. You can also reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and bake for an additional 40-50 minutes if you initially preheated to 425°F.\n6.  **Cool:** Let the pie cool completely on a wire rack for at least 2 hours. For best results, chill in the refrigerator overnight before serving.\n\n**Where to Find Ingredients:**\n\n*   **Dates (Medjool):** These can often be found in the dried fruit section of most major grocery stores, health food stores, and online retailers.\n*   **Maple Syrup:** Available in the syrup or baking aisle of most supermarkets.\n*   **Pumpkin Puree:** Look for canned, pure pumpkin puree in the baking aisle of grocery stores. Avoid \"pumpkin pie filling,\" which often contains added sugars.\n*   **Spices (Cinnamon, Ginger, Nutmeg):** These are standard baking ingredients found in the spice aisle of any grocery store.\n*   **Eggs and Milk:** Readily available at any grocery store.\n*   **Almond Flour/Oat Flour:** Health food stores and the baking or natural foods section of larger supermarkets typically carry these.\n*   **Sugar-Free Baking Ingredients:** For specifically sugar-free pie crusts or alternative sweeteners like monk fruit or allulose, check specialty health food stores or online retailers like ChocZero and GOALZ Chocolates. Some online stores like Plantiful Kitchen also offer refined sugar-free baked goods and ingredients. Target also has a selection of \"No Added Sugar\" baking mixes.\n\nEnjoy your delicious and healthy sugar-free pumpkin pie!\ningredients_assistant > Here are the ingredients for the sugar-free pumpkin pie recipe:\n\n**For the Pie Filling:**\n\n*   1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust (homemade or store-bought, ensure it's sugar-free if store-bought)\n*   1/2 cup soft Medjool dates, pitted and chopped\n*   1/4 cup pure maple syrup\n*   1 1/2 cups pumpkin puree (ensure it's pure pumpkin, not pie filling)\n*   1 teaspoon cinnamon\n*   1 teaspoon ground ginger\n*   1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n*   1/2 teaspoon salt\n*   3 large eggs\n*   1 cup milk (whole milk, almond milk, or coconut milk can be used)\n*   *Optional:* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\n**For the Crust (if making homemade):**\n\n*   2 1/2 cups almond flour or oat flour\n*   1/2 cup soft Medjool dates, pitted and chopped\n*   4 tablespoons almond milk\ningredients_assistant > **Top 2 Stores for Ingredients:**\n\n1.  **Major Grocery Stores (e.g., Kroger, Safeway, Publix, Walmart Supercenter):** These stores will carry the vast majority of your ingredients. You'll find pumpkin puree, spices, eggs, milk, maple syrup, and often a good selection of almond flour/oat flour in their baking or natural foods aisles. Some larger chains also carry Medjool dates in their dried fruit section.\n2.  **Health Food Stores (e.g., Whole Foods Market, Sprouts):** These stores are excellent for sourcing Medjool dates, a wider variety of almond and oat flours, and potentially sugar-free pie crust options or alternative sweeteners if you choose to adapt the recipe further. They also have a comprehensive selection of all the other standard ingredients.\nprice_estimation_assistant > I can help you with that! I will assume you are shopping at a major grocery store like Walmart, Kroger, or Safeway, as they carry most of these items. Prices can vary by location and brand, but here are my best estimates for the ingredients needed for the sugar-free pumpkin pie recipe:\n\n**For the Pie Filling:**\n\n*   **1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust:** (If store-bought and sugar-free) - **$3.50 - $5.00** (This can be tricky to find sugar-free. If you make it homemade, the cost will be from the crust ingredients below).\n*   **1/2 cup soft Medjool dates, pitted and chopped:** (A standard 8oz package yields more than this, so you'll have some left over) - **$5.00 - $7.00** per package\n*   **1/4 cup pure maple syrup:** (A 8oz bottle yields more than this) - **$6.00 - $9.00** per bottle\n*   **1 1/2 cups pumpkin puree:** (Two 15oz cans) - **$2.00 - $3.00** per can ($4.00 - $6.00 total)\n*   **1 teaspoon cinnamon:** (A standard spice jar yields much more) - **$3.00 - $5.00** per jar\n*   **1 teaspoon ground ginger:** (A standard spice jar yields much more) - **$3.00 - $5.00** per jar\n*   **1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg:** (A standard spice jar yields much more) - **$3.00 - $5.00** per jar\n*   **1/2 teaspoon salt:** (A standard salt container yields much more) - **$1.00 - $2.00** per container\n*   **3 large eggs:** - **$3.00 - $5.00** per dozen\n*   **1 cup milk:** (Whole, almond, or coconut milk) - **$2.50 - $4.50** per half-gallon or quart depending on type\n*   **Optional: 1 teaspoon vanilla extract:** (A standard bottle yields much more) - **$4.00 - $6.00** per bottle\n\n**For the Crust (if making homemade):**\n\n*   **2 1/2 cups almond flour:** (A 16oz bag yields more than this) - **$7.00 - $10.00** per bag\n*   **1/2 cup soft Medjool dates, pitted and chopped:** (This is in addition to the filling, so you'd need another 1/2 cup. The 8oz package is likely sufficient for both if you measure carefully.) - Already accounted for above.\n*   **4 tablespoons almond milk:** (A small amount from the milk you buy for the filling) - Already accounted for above.\n\n**Estimated Total Cost (if making the crust homemade and assuming you'll have leftovers of spices, maple syrup, dates, flour, and vanilla):**\n\n*   **Minimum Estimate:** ~$40.00\n*   **Maximum Estimate:** ~$62.00\n\n**Important Notes on Pricing:**\n\n*   **Brand Variation:** Store brands are generally cheaper than name brands.\n*   **Package Sizes:** The prices are for standard package sizes. You will likely have leftover ingredients for future use, which makes the per-recipe cost lower.\n*   **Sales and Coupons:** Keep an eye out for sales and coupons, which can significantly reduce the overall cost.\n*   **Sugar-Free Crust:** Finding a pre-made, *truly* sugar-free pie crust can be difficult and expensive. Making it from scratch with almond flour is often more cost-effective and guarantees it's sugar-free.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"👉 Note that we are using the Python Runner directly in this notebook.

Press half of the dough evenly into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie dish. Set the remaining dough aside for the top crust.\n2.  **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).\n3.  **Prepare the Filling:** In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, chopped dates, maple syrup, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice (if using), and cornstarch/arrowroot powder. Toss gently to coat the apples evenly. If using butter or coconut oil, dot it over the apple mixture.\n4.  **Assemble the Pie:** Pour the apple filling into the prepared bottom crust.\n5.  **Create the Top Crust:** You can either roll out the remaining dough and place it as a solid top crust, cutting vents for steam, or cut it into strips for a lattice top. Crimp the edges to seal.\n6.  **Bake:** Place the pie on a baking sheet (to catch any drips) and bake for 45-55 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. If the crust starts to brown too quickly, loosely tent the pie with aluminum foil.\n7.  **Cool:** Let the pie cool on a wire rack for at least 2-3 hours before slicing and serving.

Prices are estimates and can vary by location and brand.\n\n---\n\n**Classic Apple Pie**\n\nThis recipe focuses on a traditional apple pie, which typically uses refined sugar. If you're looking for a sugar-free version, please refer to the previous sugar-free apple pie recipe.\n\n**Yields:** 8 servings\n**Prep time:** 30 minutes\n**Cook time:** 50-60 minutes\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**For the Filling:**\n\n*   6-7 medium apples (e.g., Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, Gala), peeled, cored, and sliced about 1/4-inch thick\n*   3/4 cup granulated sugar (or a mix of granulated and brown sugar)\n*   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (or cornstarch)\n*   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n*   1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n*   1/8 teaspoon ground allspice (optional)\n*   1 tablespoon lemon juice\n*   2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n\n**For the Crust:**\n\n*   2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n*   1 teaspoon salt\n*   1 cup (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes\n*   1/2 cup ice water (plus more if needed)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Make the Crust:**\n    *   In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.\n    *   Cut in the cold butter using a pastry blender or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces of butter remaining.\n    *   Gradually add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough just comes together. Be careful not to overmix.\n    *   Divide the dough in half, flatten each half into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\n2.  **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).\n3.  **Prepare the Filling:**\n    *   In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, sugar, flour (or cornstarch), cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice (if using), and lemon juice. Toss gently to coat the apples evenly.\n4.  **Assemble the Pie:**\n    *   On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disk of dough into a 12-inch circle. Carefully transfer it to a 9-inch pie plate. Trim and crimp the edges.\n    *   Pour the apple filling into the crust. Dot the top with the small pieces of butter.\n    *   Roll out the second disk of dough. You can either place it as a solid top crust (cutting vents for steam) or cut it into strips for a lattice top. Crimp the edges to seal.\n5.  **Bake:**\n    *   Place the pie on a baking sheet (to catch any drips). Bake at 425°F (220°C) for 15 minutes.\n    *   Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C) and continue baking for another 35-45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. If the crust starts to brown too quickly, loosely tent the pie with aluminum foil.\n6.  **Cool:** Let the pie cool on a wire rack for at least 2-3 hours before slicing and serving.

They are a quintessential Indian dessert, often served during festivals and celebrations. This recipe uses milk powder, which is more readily available than traditional khoya (milk solids).\n\n**Yields:** Approximately 20-24 gulab jamuns\n**Prep time:** 30 minutes (+ 10 minutes resting)\n**Cook time:** 20-30 minutes (frying) + 2-3 hours (soaking)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**For the Gulab Jamun Balls:**\n\n*   1 ½ cups milk powder (whole milk powder recommended for best results)\n*   ½ cup all-purpose flour (maida)\n*   ½ teaspoon baking powder\n*   ¼ teaspoon salt (optional, some recipes omit)\n*   2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter), melted, plus more for greasing fingers\n*   2-4 tablespoons milk (lukewarm), as needed to form dough or 1 cup whipping cream\n*   1 tablespoon natural yogurt or ¼ teaspoon lemon juice (acts as a binder)\n*   *Optional additions:* Chopped almonds, pistachios, or golden raisins\n\n**For the Sugar Syrup:**\n\n*   1 ¼ cups white sugar or 2 cups sugar or 3 cups sugar\n*   7 fluid ounces water or 1.5 cups water or 2 cups water or 4 cups water\n*   2-4 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed\n*   A few drops of rose water\n*   *Optional:* ¼ teaspoon saffron strands, soaked in 2 tablespoons warm water\n\n**For Frying:**\n\n*   Vegetable oil or ghee for deep frying (about 3-4 cups)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Prepare the Dough:**\n    *   In a large bowl, combine the milk powder, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt (if using). Mix well.\n    *   Add the melted ghee and mix until the flour is moist.\n    *   In a small bowl, combine the yogurt/lemon juice with 2 tablespoons of milk. Add this to the dry ingredients.\n    *   Gradually add more milk (or whipping cream) as needed, mixing with a spoon or your fingers to form a soft, smooth dough. Do not knead vigorously; just bring it together.\n    *   Cover the dough and let it rest for about 10-20 minutes.\n\n2.  **Prepare the Sugar Syrup:**\n    *   While the dough rests, combine the sugar, water, and crushed cardamom pods in a saucepan.\n    *   Heat over medium flame, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely.\n    *   Bring to a boil and simmer for about 5-7 minutes, or until the syrup becomes slightly sticky. To check for stickiness, take a ¼ teaspoon of syrup, cool it slightly, and rub it between your thumb and forefinger; it should feel sticky and slightly stringy but not form a one-string consistency.\n    *   Turn off the heat. Stir in the rose water and saffron (if using). Keep the syrup warm.\n\n3.  **Shape the Gulab Jamuns:**\n    *   Grease your palms lightly with ghee.\n    *   Take small portions of the dough and gently roll them between your palms to form smooth, crack-free balls (about 1 inch in diameter). Ensure there are no cracks, as this can cause them to break during frying.\n\n4.  **Fry the Gulab Jamuns:**\n    *   Heat the oil or ghee in a deep pan or wok over medium heat. The oil should be medium hot, not too hot. To test, drop a tiny piece of dough; it should rise slowly with bubbles. If it rises too quickly or browns fast, the oil is too hot; let it cool slightly.\n    *   Gently slide the dough balls into the oil, in batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan.\n    *   Fry on medium heat for 1-2 minutes, then reduce the flame to low or medium-low.\n    *   Keep stirring gently and fry until the gulab jamuns turn an even, deep golden brown color. This typically takes about 5-7 minutes per batch.\n    *   Remove the fried gulab jamuns with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels.\n\n5.  **Soak in Syrup:**\n    *   Immediately transfer the warm, fried gulab jamuns into the warm sugar syrup.\n    *   Let them soak for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight, to absorb the syrup and become soft and spongy.\n\n6.  **Serve:**\n    *   Serve the gulab jamun warm or at room temperature. They can be garnished with chopped pistachios or almonds.\n\n**Where to Find Ingredients:**\n\n*   **Milk Powder:** Available in the dairy or baking aisle of most major grocery stores.

This method often results in a richer, more traditional flavor.\n\n**Traditional Gulab Jamun (using Khoya or Ricotta)**\n\nThis recipe uses khoya, which is essentially evaporated milk solids. If khoya is not readily available, good quality whole milk ricotta cheese can be used as a substitute, though the texture and flavor will be slightly different.\n\n**Yields:** Approximately 20-24 gulab jamuns\n**Prep time:** 30 minutes\n**Cook time:** 20-30 minutes (frying) + 2-3 hours (soaking)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**For the Gulab Jamun Balls:**\n\n*   1 cup khoya (mawa), crumbled or grated (see notes below for ricotta substitute)\n*   ¼ cup all-purpose flour (maida)\n*   1 tablespoon all-purpose flour (maida) for dusting\n*   ¼ teaspoon baking soda (not baking powder)\n*   1 tablespoon ghee, melted, plus more for greasing fingers\n*   *Optional additions:* 1-2 tablespoons chopped almonds or pistachios, a pinch of ground cardamom\n\n**For the Sugar Syrup:**\n\n*   1 ¼ cups white sugar (or 2 cups, or 3 cups)\n*   7 fluid ounces water (or 1.5 cups, or 2 cups, or 4 cups)\n*   2-4 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed\n*   A few drops of rose water\n*   *Optional:* ¼ teaspoon saffron strands, soaked in 2 tablespoons warm water\n\n**For Frying:**\n\n*   Vegetable oil or ghee for deep frying (about 3-4 cups)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Prepare the Khoya/Ricotta:**\n    *   **If using Khoya:** Ensure the khoya is at room temperature. Crumble or grate it finely.\n    *   **If using Ricotta:** Drain the ricotta cheese very well to remove as much moisture as possible. You can do this by placing it in a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth or a clean kitchen towel over a bowl for at least 30 minutes, or by gently pressing out the excess liquid. You want a firm, crumbly texture, not wet.\n\n2.  **Prepare the Dough:**\n    *   In a bowl, combine the crumbled khoya (or well-drained ricotta), ¼ cup all-purpose flour, melted ghee, and baking soda.\n    *   Mix gently with your fingers until it just comes together to form a soft dough. Do not overmix or knead, as this can make the gulab jamuns tough.\n    *   If the dough is too sticky, add a little of the extra flour for dusting. If it seems too dry, add a teaspoon of milk or water.\n\n3.  **Prepare the Sugar Syrup:**\n    *   Combine the sugar, water, and crushed cardamom pods in a saucepan.\n    *   Heat over medium flame, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely.\n    *   Bring to a boil and simmer for about 5-7 minutes, or until the syrup becomes slightly sticky. To check for stickiness, take a ¼ teaspoon of syrup, cool it slightly, and rub it between your thumb and forefinger; it should feel sticky and slightly stringy but not form a one-string consistency.\n    *   Turn off the heat. Stir in the rose water and saffron (if using). Keep the syrup warm.\n\n4.  **Shape the Gulab Jamuns:**\n    *   Grease your palms lightly with ghee.\n    *   Take small portions of the dough and gently roll them between your palms to form smooth, crack-free balls (about 1 inch in diameter). Ensure there are no cracks.\n    *   If adding nuts or cardamom, gently press a small amount into the center of a dough ball before shaping it into a smooth sphere.\n\n5.  **Fry the Gulab Jamuns:**\n    *   Heat the oil or ghee in a deep pan or wok over medium heat. The oil should be medium hot, not too hot. To test, drop a tiny piece of dough; it should rise slowly with bubbles. If it rises too quickly or browns fast, the oil is too hot; let it cool slightly.\n    *   Gently slide the dough balls into the oil, in batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan.\n    *   Fry on medium heat for 1-2 minutes, then reduce the flame to low or medium-low.\n    *   Keep stirring gently and fry until the gulab jamuns turn an even, deep golden brown color. This typically takes about 7-10 minutes per batch, as khoya/ricotta takes longer to cook than milk powder.\n    *   Remove the fried gulab jamuns with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels.\n\n6.  **Soak in Syrup:**\n    *   Immediately transfer the warm, fried gulab jamuns into the warm sugar syrup.\n    *   Let them soak for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight, to absorb the syrup and become soft and spongy.\n\n7.  **Serve:**\n    *   Serve the gulab jamun warm or at room temperature. Garnish with chopped pistachios or almonds if desired.\n\n**Notes on Khoya and Ricotta:**\n\n*   **Khoya (Mawa):** This is the most traditional ingredient. You can buy it from Indian grocery stores. If you want to make khoya at home, it involves simmering milk for a long time until it reduces to solids, which is a time-consuming process.\n*   **Ricotta Cheese Substitute:** Use whole milk ricotta cheese and ensure it is very well-drained. The texture of the gulab jamun will be slightly softer and perhaps a bit more delicate. The flavor will be good, but not exactly the same as khoya-based ones.\n\n**Where to Find Ingredients:**\n\n*   **Khoya (Mawa):** Primarily found in Indian or South Asian grocery stores.\n*   **Ricotta Cheese (Whole Milk):** Available in the dairy section of most major grocery stores.\n*   **All-Purpose Flour (Maida):** Found in the baking aisle of any grocery store.\n*   **Baking Soda:** Available in the baking aisle of all grocery stores.\n*   **Ghee (Clarified Butter):** Available in the international foods aisle of many larger supermarkets, and commonly found in Indian or Middle Eastern grocery stores.\n*   **Milk, Yogurt, Lemon Juice:** Readily available at any grocery store.\n*   **Sugar, Water:** Standard pantry staples available at all grocery stores.\n*   **Cardamom Pods, Rose Water, Saffron:** Found in the spice aisle of larger supermarkets or in the international foods section.
