You can find these ingredients at most major grocery stores like Walmart, Kroger, and Target, as well as health food stores like Whole Foods.\n\n**Sugar-Free Pumpkin Pie with Date-Fig Crust**\n\nThis recipe offers a naturally sweetened filling and a no-bake crust.\n\n**Yields:** 8-10 servings\n**Prep time:** 30 minutes\n**Cook time:** 50-60 minutes (for filling)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n*   **For the No-Bake Crust:**\n    *   1 cup pitted dates (about 10-12 Medjool dates)\n    *   1/2 cup dried figs\n    *   1/4 cup almond flour or shredded unsweetened coconut\n    *   Pinch of salt\n\n*   **For the Sugar-Free Pumpkin Filling:**\n    *   1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)\n    *   3 large eggs\n    *   1 cup unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk\n    *   1/2 cup erythritol or monk fruit sweetener (or to taste)\n    *   2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n    *   1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice\n    *   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n    *   1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Prepare the Crust:** In a food processor, combine the pitted dates, dried figs, almond flour (or coconut), and salt. Pulse until the mixture is well combined and has a sticky, dough-like consistency. Press this mixture evenly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie plate. You can also refrigerate the crust for about 30 minutes to firm it up before adding the filling.\n2.  **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).\n3.  **Make the Filling:** In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, almond milk (or coconut milk), erythritol or monk fruit sweetener, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, and salt until smooth and well combined.\n4.  **Assemble the Pie:** Pour the pumpkin filling into the prepared crust.\n5.  **Bake:** Place the pie on a baking sheet (to catch any potential drips) and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the center is set but still slightly jiggly. A knife inserted near the center should come out clean.\n6.  **Cool:** Let the pie cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and serving. For best results, chilling it in the refrigerator for at least a few hours or overnight will help it set fully.\n\n**Alternative Sweeteners:**\n\n*   If you prefer not to use dates and figs, you can use sugar substitutes like stevia, erythritol, or monk fruit sweetener for the crust as well, adjusting the amount to your desired sweetness.\n\n**Where to Buy Ingredients:**\n\n*   **Dates and Figs:** Found in the dried fruit section of most major supermarkets (Walmart, Kroger, Target) and health food stores (Whole Foods, Trader Joe's).\n*   **Almond Flour/Shredded Coconut:** Available in the baking aisle of supermarkets and health food stores.\n*   **Pumpkin Puree:** Canned pumpkin puree is in the baking or canned goods aisle of most grocery stores.\n*   **Eggs, Milk, Vanilla Extract, Spices, Salt:** Standard pantry staples found in any grocery store.\n*   **Erythritol/Monk Fruit Sweetener:** Look for these in the baking or health food sections of supermarkets, or in dedicated health food stores.

This recipe uses dried apples and other dried fruits for a rich, flavorful filling.\n\n**Sugar-Free Apple Pie with Dried Fruit**\n\nThis recipe gets its sweetness from dried fruits and can be made with a homemade or store-bought pie crust.\n\n**Yields:** 8-10 servings\n**Prep time:** 15 minutes + 1 hour standing time for apples\n**Cook time:** 80 minutes\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n*   **For the Filling:**\n    *   3 cups dried apple slices\n    *   2 ½ cups apple juice or apple cider\n    *   10 ounces dried fruits (a combination of dried cherries, chopped dried figs, dried cranberries, currants, raisins)\n    *   1 tablespoon lemon zest (from 1 whole lemon)\n    *   ½ ounce cornstarch\n    *   1 teaspoon cinnamon\n    *   1 pinch grated nutmeg\n    *   *Optional:* 1/2 cup pitted dates, chopped, for extra sweetness\n    *   *Optional:* 1/3 cup raisins\n    *   *Optional:* Juice of ½ lemon\n\n*   **For the Crust:**\n    *   Your favorite recipe for a double-crust 9-inch pie\n    *   *Alternatively, for a no-sugar-added crust:* Use a recipe that incorporates ingredients like oats, whole wheat flour, walnuts, and dates.\n\n*   **For Assembly:**\n    *   1 large whole egg, lightly beaten (for egg wash)\n    *   Sanding sugar for topping (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Prepare the Dried Apples:** In a medium saucepan, combine the dried apple slices with apple juice or cider. Bring to a boil, then cover and let stand for 1 hour.\n2.  **Cook the Apples:** After the standing time, cook the apples in the juice for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain any excess liquid if necessary.\n3.  **Prepare the Dried Fruit Mixture:** In a separate bowl, combine the other dried fruits, lemon zest, cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg. If using, add the chopped dates, raisins, and lemon juice.\n4.  **Combine Filling:** Add the cooked apple mixture to the dried fruit mixture and stir well to combine.\n5.  **Assemble the Pie:**\n    *   Prepare your pie crust according to your recipe. Line a 9-inch pie pan with the bottom crust.\n    *   Pour the apple and dried fruit filling into the crust.\n    *   Cover with the top crust. You can create a lattice top or a full crust. Crimp the edges to seal.\n    *   Brush the top crust with the beaten egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar, if using.\n    *   Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.\n6.  **Bake:** Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Bake the pie for 50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. If the crust begins to brown too quickly, you can loosely tent it with foil.\n7.  **Cool:** Let the pie cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and serving, at least 2 hours.\n\n**Where to Find Ingredients:**\n\n*   **Dried Fruits (apples, figs, cherries, cranberries, raisins, dates):** These can be found in the dried fruit section of most major grocery stores like Walmart and Kroger, as well as health food stores such as Whole Foods Market and Trader Joe's.

Do not overmix.\n    *   Divide the dough in half, flatten each half into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\n    *   *Alternatively:* Use pre-made refrigerated pie crusts according to package directions.\n\n2.  **Prepare the Filling:**\n    *   In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, flour (or cornstarch), cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Toss gently to coat the apples evenly.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Pie:**\n    *   Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).\n    *   On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disc of dough into a 12-inch circle. Carefully transfer it to a 9-inch pie plate. Trim any excess dough, leaving about a 1-inch overhang.\n    *   Pour the apple filling into the crust. Dot the top of the filling with the small pieces of butter.\n    *   Roll out the second disc of dough. Place it over the filling. Trim the excess dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Crimp the edges of the top and bottom crusts together to seal. Cut several slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.\n    *   Brush the top crust with the beaten egg wash and sprinkle with sugar, if desired.\n\n4.  **Bake:**\n    *   Place the pie on a baking sheet (to catch any drips).\n    *   Bake for 20 minutes at 400°F (200°C).\n    *   Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C) and continue baking for another 30-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. If the crust starts to brown too quickly, loosely tent it with foil.\n\n5.  **Cool:**\n    *   Let the pie cool completely on a wire rack for at least 2-3 hours before slicing and serving. This allows the filling to set properly.\n\n---\n\n**Ingredients and Stores Showing Availability:**\n\nHere are the ingredients for the Classic Apple Pie, with stores where you can find them:\n\n*   **All-Purpose Flour:**\n    *   **Walmart:** Baking aisle\n    *   **Kroger:** Baking aisle\n    *   **Whole Foods Market:** Baking aisle\n    *   **Trader Joe's:** Baking aisle\n\n*   **Salt:**\n    *   **Walmart:** Baking aisle\n    *   **Kroger:** Baking aisle\n    *   **Whole Foods Market:** Baking aisle\n    *   **Trader Joe's:** Baking aisle\n\n*   **Unsalted Butter:**\n    *   **Walmart:** Dairy aisle\n    *   **Kroger:** Dairy aisle\n    *   **Whole Foods Market:** Dairy aisle\n    *   **Trader Joe's:** Dairy aisle\n\n*   **Apples (e.g., Granny Smith, Honeycrisp):**\n    *   **Walmart:** Produce section\n    *   **Kroger:** Produce section\n    *   **Whole Foods Market:** Produce section\n    *   **Trader Joe's:** Produce section\n\n*   **Granulated Sugar:**\n    *   **Walmart:** Baking aisle\n    *   **Kroger:** Baking aisle\n    *   **Whole Foods Market:** Baking aisle\n    *   **Trader Joe's:** Baking aisle\n\n*   **Cornstarch (if using as an alternative to flour):**\n    *   **Walmart:** Baking aisle\n    *   **Kroger:** Baking aisle\n    *   **Whole Foods Market:** Baking aisle\n    *   **Trader Joe's:** Baking aisle\n\n*   **Ground Cinnamon:**\n    *   **Walmart:** Spice aisle\n    *   **Kroger:** Spice aisle\n    *   **Whole Foods Market:** Spice aisle\n    *   **Trader Joe's:** Spice aisle\n\n*   **Ground Nutmeg:**\n    *   **Walmart:** Spice aisle\n    *   **Kroger:** Spice aisle\n    *   **Whole Foods Market:** Spice aisle\n    *   **Trader Joe's:** Spice aisle\n\n*   **Lemon:**\n    *   **Walmart:** Produce section\n    *   **Kroger:** Produce section\n    *   **Whole Foods Market:** Produce section\n    *   **Trader Joe's:** Produce section\n\n*   **Large Egg:**\n    *   **Walmart:** Dairy/Refrigerated aisle\n    *   **Kroger:** Dairy/Refrigerated aisle\n    *   **Whole Foods Market:** Dairy/Refrigerated aisle\n    *   **Trader Joe's:** Dairy/Refrigerated aisle\n\n*   **Refrigerated Pie Crusts (if using pre-made):**\n    *   **Walmart:** Refrigerated section near doughs and biscuits\n    *   **Kroger:** Refrigerated section near doughs and biscuits\n    *   **Whole Foods Market:** Refrigerated section near doughs and biscuits\n    *   **Trader Joe's:** Refrigerated section near doughs and biscuits\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You can see a summary of ADK and its available languages in the response.\n\n### How does it work?\n\nThe agent performed a Google Search to get the latest information about ADK, and it knew to use this tool because:\n\n1.

They are a quintessential Indian dessert, perfect for celebrations and festivals.\n\n**Yields:** Approximately 26-30 Gulab Jamuns\n**Prep time:** 30 minutes (plus 30 minutes resting time for dough)\n**Cook time:** 20-30 minutes for frying + 3 hours for soaking\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n*   **For the Dough:**\n    *   100g milk powder (full-cream recommended for richness)\n    *   60g all-purpose flour (maida)\n    *   20g semolina (rava)\n    *   ¼ teaspoon baking powder\n    *   20g unsalted butter, melted\n    *   80ml whole milk (adjust as needed for dough consistency)\n    *   *Optional:* 200g khoya (milk solids) or paneer, grated, if making traditionally\n\n*   **For the Sugar Syrup:**\n    *   500g granulated sugar\n    *   500ml water\n    *   6 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed\n    *   A few strands of saffron\n    *   1 tablespoon rose water\n    *   *Optional:* 1 ice cube or juice of ½ lemon to prevent crystallization.\n\n*   **For Frying:**\n    *   Vegetable oil or ghee (clarified butter)\n\n*   **For Garnish (Optional):**\n    *   Chopped pistachios or almonds\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Prepare the Sugar Syrup:** In a saucepan, combine sugar, water, crushed cardamom pods, and saffron. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until the syrup is sticky and forms a thin thread when a drop is pulled between your fingers (about 5 minutes). Do not overcook, or it will become hard. Remove from heat, stir in rose water and lemon juice (if using). Cover and set aside to keep warm.\n\n2.  **Make the Dough:** In a bowl, whisk together milk powder, all-purpose flour, semolina, and baking powder. If using khoya or paneer, add it now and mix well. Add the melted butter and gradually add milk, mixing gently until a soft, pliable dough forms. Do not knead vigorously; just bring the ingredients together. The dough should be smooth and crack-free. Cover the dough and let it rest for about 20-30 minutes.\n\n3.  **Shape the Gulab Jamuns:** Divide the dough into small, equal portions. Gently roll each portion between your palms to form smooth, crack-free balls. Ensure there are no cracks, as this can cause them to break during frying.\n\n4.  **Fry the Gulab Jamuns:** Heat oil or ghee in a deep pan over medium-low heat. The oil should be medium hot, not smoking hot. To test, drop a tiny piece of dough; it should rise slowly with bubbles. Gently drop the dough balls into the hot oil in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry them on medium-low heat, stirring gently and continuously to ensure even browning. Fry until they are golden brown and slightly firm.\n\n5.  **Soak in Syrup:** Once fried, immediately transfer the hot gulab jamuns into the warm sugar syrup. Let them soak for at least 3 hours, or preferably longer, to allow them to absorb the syrup and become soft and juicy. For an even richer flavor and texture, you can gently heat the syrup with the jamuns in it for a minute or two on low flame after adding them.\n\n6.  **Serve:** Garnish with chopped pistachios or almonds if desired. Gulab Jamun can be served warm or at room temperature.\n\n**Where to Buy Ingredients:**\n\n*   **Milk Powder, All-Purpose Flour, Semolina, Baking Powder, Sugar, Cardamom Pods, Saffron, Rose Water, Vegetable Oil/Ghee:** These are staple ingredients and can be found in the baking, spice, and cooking oil aisles of most major supermarkets like **Walmart**, **Kroger**, and **Target**.

Khoya is traditionally used, but this version offers a great alternative.\n\n**Yields:** Approximately 20-25 Gulab Jamuns\n**Prep time:** 25 minutes (plus 30 minutes resting time for dough)\n**Cook time:** 20-30 minutes for frying + 3 hours for soaking\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n*   **For the Dough:**\n    *   ½ cup all-purpose flour (maida)\n    *   ¼ cup semolina (rava)\n    *   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (additional, if needed for dough consistency)\n    *   ¼ teaspoon baking powder\n    *   2 tablespoons butter or ghee, melted\n    *   ½ cup whole milk, lukewarm (adjust as needed for dough consistency)\n    *   *Optional:* A pinch of salt to enhance flavor.\n\n*   **For the Sugar Syrup:**\n    *   2 cups granulated sugar\n    *   2 cups water\n    *   2-3 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed\n    *   A few strands of saffron (optional, for color and aroma)\n    *   1 tablespoon rose water (optional, for fragrance)\n    *   *Optional:* Juice of ½ lemon or 1 ice cube to prevent crystallization\n\n*   **For Frying:**\n    *   Vegetable oil or ghee (clarified butter) for deep frying\n\n*   **For Garnish (Optional):**\n    *   Chopped pistachios or almonds\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Prepare the Sugar Syrup:** In a saucepan, combine sugar, water, crushed cardamom pods, and saffron (if using). Heat over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the syrup reaches a slightly sticky consistency (it should form a thin thread when a drop is pulled between your fingers). Stir in rose water and lemon juice (if using). Remove from heat, cover, and keep warm.\n\n2.  **Make the Dough:** In a mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, semolina, and baking powder. Add the melted butter or ghee and mix well. Gradually add the lukewarm milk, a little at a time, and mix gently to form a soft, pliable dough. Do not knead vigorously, as this can make the gulab jamuns hard. The dough should be smooth and free of cracks. If the dough is too stiff, add a little more milk; if too soft, add a teaspoon or two of the additional all-purpose flour. Cover the dough and let it rest for 20-30 minutes.\n\n3.  **Shape the Gulab Jamuns:** Divide the dough into small, equal portions. Gently roll each portion between your palms to form smooth, crack-free balls. Ensure there are no cracks, as this can cause them to break during frying. Greasing your hands lightly with oil can help in rolling smooth balls.\n\n4.  **Fry the Gulab Jamuns:** Heat vegetable oil or ghee in a deep pan over medium-low heat. The oil should be moderately hot, not smoking. To test the temperature, drop a tiny piece of dough; it should rise slowly with gentle bubbles. Carefully add the dough balls to the hot oil in batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Fry on medium-low heat, stirring gently and continuously to ensure even browning. Fry until the gulab jamuns turn a uniform golden brown color.\n\n5.  **Soak in Syrup:** Immediately transfer the hot, fried gulab jamuns into the warm sugar syrup. Let them soak for at least 3 hours, or preferably longer, to absorb the syrup and become soft and juicy. For an even richer texture, you can gently heat the syrup with the gulab jamuns in it for a minute or two on low heat after adding them.\n\n6.  **Serve:** Garnish with chopped pistachios or almonds, if desired. Gulab Jamuns are best served warm or at room temperature.\n\n**Where to Buy Ingredients:**\n\n*   **All-Purpose Flour (Maida), Semolina (Rava), Granulated Sugar, Baking Powder, Vegetable Oil/Ghee, Cardamom Pods, Saffron, Rose Water, Pistachios/Almonds:** These ingredients are readily available at most major grocery stores like **Walmart**, **Kroger**, and **Target**. For a wider selection of Indian spices and specialty items like rose water, saffron, and ghee, **Ambika Veg and Vegan Shop** or other local Indian grocery stores are excellent choices.\n*   **Whole Milk, Butter:** Available in the dairy section of all major supermarkets.\n*   **Lemons:** Found in the produce section of grocery stores.\ningredients_assistant > Here are the ingredients for Gulab Jamun made without milk powder:\n\n*   ½ cup all-purpose flour (maida)\n*   ¼ cup semolina (rava)\n*   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (additional, if needed for dough consistency)\n*   ¼ teaspoon baking powder\n*   2 tablespoons butter or ghee, melted\n*   ½ cup whole milk, lukewarm (adjust as needed for dough consistency)\n*   *Optional:* A pinch of salt to enhance flavor.\n*   2 cups granulated sugar\n*   2 cups water\n*   2-3 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed\n*   A few strands of saffron (optional, for color and aroma)\n*   1 tablespoon rose water (optional, for fragrance)\n*   *Optional:* Juice of ½ lemon or 1 ice cube to prevent crystallization\n*   Vegetable oil or ghee (clarified butter) for deep frying\n*   *Optional:* Chopped pistachios or almondsThe top 2 stores where the ingredients for Gulab Jamun (without milk powder) can be bought are:\n\n1.  **Walmart**\n2.  **Kroger**\ningredients_assistant > I have processed the previous requests as instructed.
